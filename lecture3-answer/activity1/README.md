# Activities

## Task 1

- Refer to the following link. Discuss how bubble sort works:
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/embed/bubblesortAV
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

```c++
// C++ program for implementation
// of Bubble sort
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// A function to implement bubble sort
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n)
{
	int i, j;
	for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)

		// Last i elements are already
		// in place
		for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
			if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1])
				swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]);
}

// Function to print an array
void printArray(int arr[], int size)
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
		cout << arr[i] << " ";
	cout << endl;
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	int arr[] = { 5, 1, 4, 2, 8};
	int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	bubbleSort(arr, N);
	cout << "Sorted array: \n";
	printArray(arr, N);
	return 0;
}
```


## Task 2

- Refer to the following link. Your task is to show the behavior for one iteration of the outer for loop of Bubble Sort (Try at least 3 cases).

## Task 3

- The following snippet is from `./src/bubble.cpp` lines 16-28. Discuss in groups how the code works:

```cpp

    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        for (j = i + 1; j < 10; j++)
        {
            if (a[j] < a[i])
            {
                temp = a[i];
                a[i] = a[j];
                a[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        pass++;
    }
```

- The following snippet is from `./src/selection.cpp` lines 34-41. Discuss in groups how the code works:

```cpp
    for (j = i + 1; j < 10; j++)
    {
        if (myarray[j] < ele_small)
        {
            ele_small = myarray[j];
            position = j;
        }
    }
```

## Task 4: Individual, at home
