## Task 3: Tree Traversal

Refer to te following links. Discuss the difference between the different ways binary trees can be traversed.

  Trees have height -- they do not have depth

  (2) Which statement is correct?
The tree is full but not complete
The tree is full and complete
The tree is complete but not full
The tree is neither full nor complete- This is correct.
