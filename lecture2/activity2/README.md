# Activities

## Task 1

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Why is Algorithm Analysis Important?
Algorithm analysis refers to the analysis of the complexity of different algorithms and finding the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem at hand. It is important to decide to choose an algorithm that is more efficient and runs faster.
- Explain the Big $O$ notation
Big-O notation signifies the relationship between the input to the algorithm and the steps required to execute the algorithm. It is denoted by a big "O" followed by an opening and closing parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis, the relationship between the input and the steps taken by the algorithm is presented using "n".
- Compare `Linear`, `Logarithmic`, `Quadratic` and `Constant` complexities.

## Task2

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple algorithm in C++ that finds the square of the first item in a list and then prints it on the screen.
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?

## Task 3

Refer to the first [link](#links).

- Write a simple program that displays all items in a list to the console.
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?

## Task 4: : Individual, at home

Refer to this [pdf](./big_o.pdf):

- What is the difference between complexity and performance:
- Does complexity affects performance bor is it the other way around?
- Restate the formal definition of big $O$ in plain English
